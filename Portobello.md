# Portobello Mushroom Sandwich

Ordered many times from Meat Cheese Bread, before they stopped making it a couple years ago. This might truly be the most delicious sandwich that you will ever eat.

## Ingredients

* portobello mushrooms (one per sandwich)
* sherry vinegar (I use leftover red wine and rice vinegar instead)
* olive oil
* sea salt
* red onion (1/4 onion per sandwich)
* frisee (any bitter green will do; arugula works well)
* blue cheese
* buttermilk (just enough to make the blue cheese a little more spreadable)
* ciabatta rolls

## Sandwich Creation

#### Prepare the mushrooms:
1. Whisk together the sherry vinegar, olive oil, and sea salt.
2. Remove the mushroom stems, flip the mushrooms upside down, and fill them with half of the wine sauce.
3. Bake upside-down in oven for 20 minutes or until quite juicy.

#### Prepare the onions, greens, and sauce:
4. Heat the rest of the wine sauce in a pan on medium heat. If the vinegar seems like it might burn, you need more oil.
5. Slice the red onions and cook over medium heat until they smell delicious.
6. While the onions are cooking, chop the bitter greens coarsely
7. Pulse the blue cheese and milk in a blender.

#### Final steps:
8. Toast the bread.
9. The mushrooms should be ready. Drain any excess liquid and slice them up.
10. Assemble sandwich and be very happy.
